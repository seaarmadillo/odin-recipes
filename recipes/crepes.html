    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, milk, egg and salt.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium high heat. When the pan is hot add a teaspoon of butter and lightly coat the surface of the pan with the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Pour one quarter cup of the batter into the pan and tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface in a smooth and even layer.</li>
            <li>Step 4: After two minutes, lift up an edge of the crepe with a spatula to see if it is browning. When the underside has begun to brown, flip the crepe and cook the other side until it is also brown; about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 to cook the remaining crepes. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
